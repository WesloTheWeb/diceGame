Practice of DOM Manipulation and RNG.

One of the few old projects I wanted to revisit. Initially I was on the developer path (full stack) but then fell in love with design UX/UI. 
While still appreciating UX/UI I am at a point where I am comfortable on Front End Web Development and want to improve my programming 
language skills. Which is why my Github hasn't been utilized in awhile. 

This is part of a series of "redoing" old projects from boot camp as well as projects that highlights a specific thing (i.e RNG,
DOM Manipulation, Experiments). I want to start using Github more actively. As well as add "upgrades" to older projects with my new
found knowledge.
